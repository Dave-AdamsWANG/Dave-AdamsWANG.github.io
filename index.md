I am now a first-year Ph.D student from the School of Data Science at City University of Hong Kong, supervised by [Prof.Xiangyu Zhao](https://zhaoxyai.github.io/) in AML Lab. I received my B.S. in statistics from [the School of Gifted Young](https://en.scgy.ustc.edu.cn/), [the University of Science and Technology of China](https://www.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2022, where I worked with [Prof.Tong Xu](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~tongxu/).

## Research Interest
My research interests focus on data mining, including automated machine learning techeniques, multi-task learning, feature engineering.
